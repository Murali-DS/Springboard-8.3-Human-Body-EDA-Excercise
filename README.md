# Springboard-8.3-Human-Body-EDA-Excercise

## Overview

Historically the average human body temperature was considered to be 98.6 F. This dataset pulled from JAMA is analyzed to infer the mean from experimental data. The mean from the data appears to be 98.2 F which is different from the historical 98.6 F. The excercise also looks at other questions such as: Is there a significant difference between male and female normal body temperature? At what temperature should someone be considered as having "abnormal" temperature?
